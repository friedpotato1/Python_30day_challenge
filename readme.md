Am doing a 30 day python challenge where i will be studying python straight for only 30 days

I made folders for each day where i have added files with simple exercises on topics discussed on each day...this files can be cloned and run on your pc

note if you want to run any code please take the small part dont run the whole file
i have added files with exercises and code that runs when the whole file is run
