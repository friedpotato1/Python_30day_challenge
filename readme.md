Day 30: PROJECT

Simple To do List
In this project, you will create a command-line based to-do list application. The application will allow users to add, view, and mark tasks as completed. Here is an outline of the project:
1. Create a main menu that displays the options for the user:
• Add a task
• View all tasks
• Mark a task as completed
• Quit the program
2. Implement the "Add a task" option, which allows the user to enter a task description and stores it in a list.
3. Implement the "View all tasks" option, which displays all the tasks (both completed and not completed) in the list.
4. Implement the "Mark a task as completed" option, which allows the user to mark a task as completed by its index in the list.
5. Use a loop to keep the program running until the user selects the "Quit the program" option.
You can use Python's built-in list data type to store the tasks and a simple text-based user interface for the menu and task input/output. This project should give you a good opportunity to practice using control flow, functions, and basic data structures in Python.

I made folders for each day where i have added files with simple exercises on topics discussed on each day...this files can be cloned and run on your pc

note if you want to run any code please take the small part dont run the whole file
i have added files with exercises and code that runs when the whole file is run

web scraping--i will post it tommorow
